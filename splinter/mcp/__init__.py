"""Strata MCP server package (S2).

Exposes the conversation store through the Model Context Protocol over the
sidecar's Streamable HTTP endpoint (``POST /v1/mcp`` in ``harness/app.py``):

- ``strata_search`` — recall curated context for a conversation.
- ``strata_remember`` — store a fact for a conversation.

``conversation_id`` is a **required tool argument** on both tools — the
server never implies it from headers, payload fields, or defaults.

This package never imports from ``harness/``: the sidecar injects a small
context object (``McpContext``) carrying the per-conversation callables, so
the tools stay portable. Import surface::
