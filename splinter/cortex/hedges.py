"""Lead-anchored refusal/hedge detection (shared by Splinter and the S6
Confirmation Gate).

Live runs showed ~50% of replies were "no information regarding X"
boilerplate. Storing them pollutes the store: the hedge is later retrieved
*as context* for the same topic, so the model sees its own refusal instead of
a fact, and keeps refusing. Filtering keeps the store fact-bearing.

Detection is **lead-anchored**: markers are matched only against the opening
of the reply (after contraction normalization), because a refusal always
announces itself at the start, whereas a factual reply may contain an
incidental "I don't have specific details about your setup" caveat mid-text
and must still be stored. (Validated against all 136 live3 replies:
11 true hedges caught — including contraction refusals — 0 false positives.)
