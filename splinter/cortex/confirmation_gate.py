"""S6 — Confirmation Gate & Imprint Grading.

Goal(plan §4.8): make *ingestion a confirmed act* rather
than an automatic one. Every generation is graded on how close it is to a
*genetic perfection imprint* — the known-correct facts for the conversation —
before it is stored. A generation that is not a close "copy" of the imprint is
rejected or flagged and never enters memory.

This directly attacks the starvation chain that kept live P2 depressed: the
model's own refusal/hedge replies were stored automatically, later retrieved
*as context*, and perpetuated refusal. S5's rule-based hedge filter
(``cortex.hedges.is_hedge_reply``) stops the worst of it by rule; the gate
replaces the rule with a *graded, confirmed act*.

Grading reuses the deterministic retrieval diagnostic's fact math:
``ingestion_ratio`` = share of imprint facts the generation actually stated.
No LLM auditor is required.

Falsifiable hypothesis (P12 — Confirmation-Gate Hypothesis; P11 is the comb):

    Confirming generations against an imprint before storage — grading on
    closeness-to-copy — raises the ingestion of genuine facts and suppresses
    hedge/refusal pollution, so that (a) ingestion_rate and (b) honest
    retrieval recall improve relative to the current rule-based hedge filter
    alone, on the same conversations, at equal run cost.

Imprints:
- ``FixtureImprint`` — offline/synthetic: the fixture's ground-truth answers
  (conversation_id -> query -> expected answer). Deterministic and cheap.
- ``DigestImprint`` — live "chronicler-lite": fact terms from previously
  *confirmed* replies per conversation. First mentions (no established facts)
  fall to a substantive-content floor instead of being graded against nothing.
