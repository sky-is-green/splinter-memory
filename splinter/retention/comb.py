"""Comb (honeycomb) — the splinter's surplus store (SSD tier).

Chunks the active store evicts are frozen here instead of dropped: content
the splinter once selected as relevant may become relevant again after a topic
change returns (long-horizon topic return). The comb is JSONL-backed
(append-only puts, crash-safe: the file is the source of truth and the
in-memory index rebuilds from it), per-conversation, and its candidates
compete for the *same* token budget as the active store — it never enlarges
the context window.

On resurrection, comb records are exempt from the decay matrix's stale
factor and from drift penalties (explicit recalls, not zombies): the P4
measurement showed the stale factor (×0.5 at age > 20) makes old facts
unretrievable at every multiplier, so a returned topic can only win the
budget by competing on raw relevance.

Archiving happens on two triggers: (1) LRU eviction (store overflow) and
(2) *stale-out* — a once-curated chunk aging past the stale wall while not
selected for the current query moves from the active store into the comb
(so production runs with large ``max_chunks`` still archive surplus).

Conflict rule (v1): an archived fact can be outdated when its topic returns.
Dedup merges near-identical versions (>0.92 cosine); for the dissimilar
but conflicting range both versions surface and the newer store chunk is
ranked by recency-of-reference — the model sees both. A recency-aware
conflict rule is a documented future refinement, not v1 behavior.

The name: bees store surplus honey in the comb so it outlives the season;
the splinter stores surplus context here so it outlives the topic.
