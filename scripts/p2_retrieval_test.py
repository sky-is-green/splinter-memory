"""P2 (handoff priority list): realistic multi-turn retrieval test.

Simulates a 50-turn conversation in which GPU facts are mentioned at turns
5, 20 and 40, then queried at turn 50. Verifies that persistent facts stay
retrievable under the current decay defaults - i.e. splinter works for its
INTENDED use case (long conversations with recurring topics), not just the
synthetic bulk-ingest worst cases.

Uses the REAL UltraSmallDrone (12M encoder) for scoring; replies are
scripted so no LLM backend is needed. Re-runnable:
